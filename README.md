1. **Exploring Pre-trained Language Models for Event Extraction and Generation.**
  _Sen Yang, Dawei Feng, Linbo Qiao, Zhigang Kan, Dongsheng Li._
  ACL 2019.
  [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1522.pdf)
  
      > We first propose an event extraction model to overcome the roles overlap problem by separating the argument prediction in terms of roles. Moreover, to address the problem of insufficient training data, we propose a method to automatically generate labeled data by editing prototypes and screen out generated samples by ranking the quality.
  
  
2. **Distilling Discrimination and Generalization Knowledge for Event Detection via ∆-Representation Learning.**
  _Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun._
  ACL 2019.
  [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1429.pdf)
  
    > This paper proposes a ∆-learning approach to distill discrimination and generalization knowledge by effectively decoupling, incrementally learning and adaptively fusing event representation.


3. **Cost-sensitive Regularization for Label Confusion-aware Event Detection.**
  _Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun._
  ACL 2019.
  [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1521.pdf)
  
    > This paper proposes cost-sensitive regularization, which can force the training procedure to concentrate more on optimizing confusing type pairs. Specifically, we introduce a costweighted term into the training loss, which penalizes more on mislabeling between confusing label pairs. Furthermore, we also propose two estimators which can effectively measure such label confusion based on instance-level or population-level statistics.
    
4. **Rapid Customization for Event Extraction.**
  _Yee Seng Chan, Joshua Fasching, Haoling Qiu, and Bonan Min._
  ACL 2019.
  [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-3006.pdf)
  
    > We present a system for rapidly customizing event extraction capability to find new event types (what happened) and their arguments (who, when, and where).
