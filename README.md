    > We argue that sentence-level approaches are ill-suited to the task and introduce a generative transformer-based encoder-decoder framework that is designed to model context at the document level.

1. **Meta-Learning with Dynamic-Memory-Based Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Event Detection.**
  _Shumin Deng, Ningyu Zhang, Jiaojian Kang, Yichi Zhang, Wei Zhang, Huajun Chen._
  arxiv 2019 [cs.CL].
  [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11621.pdf)
  
    >  We propose a Dynamic-Memory-Based Prototypical Network (DMB-PN), which exploits Dynamic Memory Network (DMN) to not only learn better prototypes for event types, but also produce more robust sentence encodings for event mentions.
    
    
2. **Extending Event Detection to New Types with Learning from Keywords.**
  _Viet Dac Lai, Thien Huu Nguyen._
  arxiv 2019 [cs.LG].
  [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11368.pdf)
  
    >  We study a novel formulation of event detection that describes types via several keywords to match the contexts in documents. This facilitates the operation of the models to new types. We introduce a novel feature-based attention mechanism for convolutional neural networks for event detection in the new formulation.   
    

3. **Event Detection in Twitter: A Keyword Volume Approach.**
  _Ahmad Hany Hossny, Lewis Mitchell._
  arxiv 2019 [cs.SI].
  [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00570.pdf)
  
    >  We propose an efficient method to select the keywords frequently used in Twitter that are mostly associated with events of interest such as protests. 
    
    
4. **CONTEXT AWARENESS AND EMBEDDING FOR BIOMEDICAL EVENT EXTRACTION.**
  _Shankai Yan, Ka-Chun Wong._
  arxiv 2019 [cs.CL].
  [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00982.pdf)
  
    >   We proposed a bottom-up event detection framework using deep learning techniques. We built an LSTM-based model VecEntNet to construct argument embeddings for each recognized entity.
