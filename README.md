### 2019

1. **Exploring Pre-trained Language Models for Event Extraction and Generation.**
  _Sen Yang, Dawei Feng, Linbo Qiao, Zhigang Kan, Dongsheng Li._
  ACL 2019.
  [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1522.pdf)
  
      > We first propose an event extraction model to overcome the roles overlap problem by separating the argument prediction in terms of roles. Moreover, to address the problem of insufficient training data, we propose a method to automatically generate labeled data by editing prototypes and screen out generated samples by ranking the quality.
  
  
2. **Distilling Discrimination and Generalization Knowledge for Event Detection via ∆-Representation Learning.**
  _Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun._
  ACL 2019.
  [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1429.pdf)
  
    > This paper proposes a ∆-learning approach to distill discrimination and generalization knowledge by effectively decoupling, incrementally learning and adaptively fusing event representation.


3. **Cost-sensitive Regularization for Label Confusion-aware Event Detection.**
  _Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun._
  ACL 2019.
  [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1521.pdf)
  
    > This paper proposes cost-sensitive regularization, which can force the training procedure to concentrate more on optimizing confusing type pairs. Specifically, we introduce a costweighted term into the training loss, which penalizes more on mislabeling between confusing label pairs. Furthermore, we also propose two estimators which can effectively measure such label confusion based on instance-level or population-level statistics.


4. **Rapid Customization for Event Extraction.**
  _Yee Seng Chan, Joshua Fasching, Haoling Qiu, and Bonan Min._
  ACL 2019.
  [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-3006.pdf)
  
    > We present a system for rapidly customizing event extraction capability to find new event types (what happened) and their arguments (who, when, and where).
    
5. **Literary Event Detection.**
  _Matthew Sims, Jong Ho Park, David Bamman._
  ACL 2019.
  [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1353.pdf)
  
    > In this work we present a new dataset of literary events—events that are depicted as taking place within the imagined space of a novel.
    
6. **Open Domain Event Extraction Using Neural Latent Variable Models.**
  _Xiao Liu, Heyan Huang, Yue Zhang._
  ACL 2019.
  [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1276.pdf)
  
    > We consider open domain event extraction, the task of extracting unconstraint types of events from news clusters. A novel latent variable neural model is constructed, which is scalable to very large corpus.   
    

### 2018

1. **Document Embedding Enhanced Event Detection with Hierarchical and Supervised Attention.**
  _Yue Zhao, Xiaolong Jin, Yuanzhuo Wang, Xueqi Cheng._
  ACL 2018.
  [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-2066.pdf)
  
    > we proposed a hierarchical and supervised attention based and document embedding enhanced Bi-RNN method, called DEEB-RNN, for event detection. We explored different strategies to construct gold word and sentence-level attentions to focus on event information.
